This is a tool I made following Ryan John's Python for Hackers Course, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fC1JsN8AsM.
It is used for scrapping (spydering) websites to find all links related to the domain name, excluding unrelated links. It will output a list of the valid links that can then be copied in to a .txt file. With this .txt, you can use the command "cat outputlist.txt | python prober.python". The prober.py tool will search all the links found by spyder.py and return wether or not they are in operation.
