This is a tool I made following Ryan John's Python for Hackers Course, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fC1JsN8AsM.
It is used for probing (prober) websites to check all links related to a valid domain name, excluding unrelated bad pages or pages that are not in operation. It will output a list of the valid links that can then be searched, knowing they are operable sites. The prober.py tool will search all the links found by spyder.py and return wether or not they are in operation.
